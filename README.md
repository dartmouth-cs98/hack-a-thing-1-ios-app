# IOS APP Beginner
For this Hack-A-Thing, I attempted to create a counting game in Swift, a language I had never experienced before.
I tried to follow a tutorial from https://learnappmaking.com/creating-a-simple-ios-game-with-swift-in-xcode/ to make a counting game.
## What I Learned
I think I now understand the basics of Swift and how the language works together at a high level.
## Struggles
I struggled a lot creating this app and ultimately was never able to finish it. I followed the tutorial to the tee and still would get errors whenever I ran it.
After a while, I realized that this must have been a deprecated tutorial with some of its syntax.
Furthermore, it was a very unique app where it attempted to create the app without using storyboards, something that isn't readily available via google when searching for the errors that were thrown.
All in all, while I think I learned the basics of Swift at a high level and how the files link together, I had a lot of trouble understanding why it was crashing and catching bugs.
